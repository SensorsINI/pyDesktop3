Notes on desktop application/environment support:

KDE           Supports file and URL opening using kfmclient, where the openURL
              command opens the resource and the exec command runs the
              resource.

GNOME         Supports file and URL opening using gnome-open.

ROX-Filer     Supports file opening using "rox <filename>" but not URL
              opening.
